I realized it would have been much more organized if I had planned a detailed development plan outlining how I would get the information and what functions I would use. I ended up using fetch() in the end, and though I wanted to do some destructuring to make the code look cleaner, I was running out of time. I found that there were still many things I wanted to do to finalize it. Throughout the process, I took notes on what I was coding because there were so many React functions I didn't understand and didn't know why I needed them."

Overall, this project provided a great opportunity to learn and implement new techniques in web development, and I'm proud of the end result."
